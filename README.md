## DATA

| --- | --- | --- |
| country | Character | Name of the country |

The score variable was extracted from the original dataset which had country and year variables with the happiness score for each country listed under the given year.


You can download the dataset from:\
[GapMinder: Happiness Score Data](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) by clicking on the "Select an indicator" drop-down menu and searching "Happiness score (WHR)". The dataset can also be downloaded from the DATA folder in this repository.

Our data was used to explore our hypothesis: *During the years 2006-2021, the happiness score of the United States has decreased 10% more than the happiness score of various countries around the world.*
